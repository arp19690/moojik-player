### Translations

If there isn't any translations in your language go to the [res folder](https://github.com/arp19690/moojik-player/tree/master/app/src/main/res) and create a file named "values-XX/strings.xml" where XX is the target language's code. Copy and paste the content of the [English base file](https://github.com/arp19690/moojik-player/tree/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) and remove all strings with "translatable=false" attribute. Translate all the keys and make a pull request.

If there is a translation in your language go to its folder in [res folder](https://github.com/arp19690/moojik-player/tree/master/app/src/main/res) and edit the strings.xml file. You'd like to update the translation with new keys by copying them from the [English base file](https://github.com/arp19690/moojik-player/tree/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml). Edit the file and make a pull request.
